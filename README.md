# Eat-moji
HackRiddle Fall 2016 Project

Eat-moji is a web application that takes in user location and then presents the user choices for what to eat in "emoji".
The user then selects an emoji, and then through a variant of the Yelp API, the application outputs the best 3 establishments
for whatever that emoji represents in their area. HTML and CSS are used for the front-end and JQuery is used to handle user interaction and the API.

Built With:
Bootstrap - HTML and CSS framework
Yelp API - Handles local data
